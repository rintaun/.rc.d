# Guidelines:
#  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
#  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
#  3. Capitalize the subject line
#  4. Do not end the subject line with a period
#  5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#  6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
#  7. Use the body to explain _what_ and _why_ vs. _how_

# --- EXAMPLE ---
#
# Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less
#
# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
# characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
# subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
# blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
# you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
# and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.
#
# Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
# are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
# Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
# change? Here's the place to explain them.
#
# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
#
#  - Bullet points are okay, too
#
#  - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
#    by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
#    vary here
#
# - Use a hanging indent
#
# If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
